create a employee directory with React.

break up your application's UI into components, 
    manage component state, 
    and respond to user events.

I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once. 
    So that I have quick access to their information.

non-sensitive data about other employees.
    filter employees by name.

The user should be able to:

  * Sort the table by at least one category

  * Filter the users by at least one property.
